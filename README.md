a free (in both ways) googley chromey extension that redirects the user to (by default) a random anti-google page, if the current page isn't one of those pages, or on an allowlist

created because my mom downloaded chromey without consulting me first, and because i have strong opinions about google

also, GH, i read your definition of technical harm, and this doesn't fall under it >:D

i still don't know what i'm going to do regarding microsoft (sometimes i wonder why that door dude decided to name it that. it's just asking to be turned into an inappropriate joke) edge, though i'm open to suggestions <:
