a free (in both ways) googley chromey extension that redirects the user to (by default) a random anti-google page, if the current page isn't one of those pages, or on an allowlist

created because my mom downloaded chromey without consulting me first, and because i have strong opinions about google

also, GH, i read your definition of technical harm, and this doesn't fall under it >:D
